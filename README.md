 # Project title:
  # Hotel Booking Reservation Cancellation using machine learning


# Introduction :

 In the dynamic landscape of the hospitality industry, one of the significant challenges faced by hoteliers is managing reservation cancellations effectively. 
 Cancellations not only impact revenue but also pose operational challenges in resource allocation and inventory management. 
 The Hotel Reservation Project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict reservation cancellations accurately 
 and develop strategies to minimize their impact on hotel operations.


 # Objectives :
### Predictive Modeling:Develop machine learning models to forecast reservation cancellations based on historical booking data and guest behavior patterns. 
This project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting hotel reservation cancellations. 
By leveraging historical booking data and relevant features, the model aims to forecast cancellations with high precision, 
enabling hotel management to implement targeted strategies to minimize revenue loss and optimize resource allocation.
